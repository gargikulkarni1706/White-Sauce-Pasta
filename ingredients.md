Pasta – I have used Penne Pasta, but you can use any variation such as Spaghetti, Macaroni, Fusilli, Fettuccine, or any other pasta of your choice. You can even make Stuffed Ravioli using this sauce as the base.

Vegetables – This is my favorite ingredient! This Pasta is a great way to feed your kids all the important vegetables that are important in day to day life. I have added onions, mushroom, mixed bell pepper and carrot but you can go ahead and add more veggies such as broccoli, zucchini, summer squash, cherry tomatoes, baby corn, spinach, kale, etc.

Milk, Cream, Cheese, and All-Purpose Flour – For the creamy white sauce in this Pasta, you will need these 4 ingredients. They together will give the perfect creamy texture to the pasta. 

Spices – Here, I have used Black Pepper, Oregano, and Red Chilli Flakes. You can even use the mixed Italian seasoning for the pasta.
